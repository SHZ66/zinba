== From Peak Refinement (refinepeaks=1) ==
If peak refinement was utilized (refinepeaks=1), then the following two files are output from ZINBA, where outfile is the outfile prefix specified in the zinba() function:

*outfile.peaks*: Information file for broad (unrefined) and short (refined) ZINBA regions


|| *PEAKID* || UCSC Genome Browser friendly coordinate of unrefined peak region ||
|| *Chrom* || Chromosome ||
|| *Start* || Start position of unrefined peak region minus 500 bp.  This is to account for possible termination of refined peak boundary just outside of merged regions ||
|| *Stop* || End position of unrefined peak region plus 500 bp.  This is to account for possible termination of refined peak boundary just outside of the merged region ||
|| *Strand* || Strand orientation of peak region ||
|| *Sig* || Maximum posterior probability of enrichment of overlapping or adjacent windows within unrefined region ||
|| *Maxloc* || Base pair position of the maximum extended read over in refined peak region ||
|| *Max* || Height at Macloc, defined by the number of overlapping extended reads at Maxloc. This is derived from the basecount file ||
|| *pStart* || Start position of refined peak region ||
|| *pStop* || Stop position of refined peak region ||
|| *Median* || Median extended read overlap of unrefined peak region, excluding the refined peak region ||
|| *qValue* || Minimum q-value of overlapping or adjacent windows within unrefined region||



*outfile.peaks.bed*:  File for unrefined peak regions 

|| *Chrom* || Chromosome ||
|| *Start* || Start position of refined peak region ||
|| *Stop* || End position of refined peak region bp||
|| *PEAKID* || UCSC Genome Browser friendly coordinate of unrefined region from the outfile.peaks file||
|| *Sig* || Maximum posterior probability of enrichment of overlapping or adjacent windows within unrefined region ||
|| *Strand* || Strand orientation of peak region ||


== Without Peak Refinement (refinepeaks=0) ==

*outfile.peaks.broad.bed*:  Bed File for unrefined peak regions 

|| *Chrom* || Chromosome ||
|| *Start* || Start position of broader peak region without any 500 bp extension of the boundaries of the merged region||
|| *Stop* || End position of broader peak region without any 500 bp extension of the boundaries of the merged region||
|| *Sig* || Maximum posterior probability of enrichment of overlapping or adjacent windows within merged region ||
|| *Strand* || Strand orientation of peak region ||
